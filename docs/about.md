## Key features What_the_Phage
* WtP is a scalable and easy-to-use workflow for phage identification and analysis. Our tool currently combines 9 established phage identification tools
* An attempt to streamline the usage of various phage identification and prediction tools
* The main focus is stability and data filtering/analysis for the user
* The tool is intended for fasta and fastq reads to identify phages in contigs/reads
    a proper Prophage detection is not implemented (yet) - but a handful of tools report them - so they are mostly identified
